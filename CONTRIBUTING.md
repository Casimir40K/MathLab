## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Before opening a bug report:
- Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
- Make sure you're using the latest version (if applicable)

When opening a bug report, include:
- A clear and descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected behaviour
- Actual behaviour
- Relevant logs, screenshots, or error messages
- Environment details (OS, version, etc.)

---

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are welcome.

When proposing a feature:
- Clearly describe the problem it solves
- Explain the proposed solution
- Mention any alternative solutions considered
- Provide examples or mockups if helpful

---

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch from `main`
3. Make your changes
4. Ensure your code builds and passes any tests
5. Submit a pull request

Please:
- Keep pull requests focused and reasonably sized
- Reference related issues where applicable
- Include a clear description of what was changed and why

---

## Development Workflow

- Use feature branches:  
  `feature/short-description`

- Use bugfix branches:  
  `fix/short-description`

- Keep branches up to date with `main`
- Avoid committing directly to `main`

---

## Code Style

- Follow the existing code style and formatting
- Write clear, readable code
- Prefer explicitness over cleverness
- Add comments where necessary
- Keep functions and modules focused and modular

If linting or formatting tools are used in this project, please run them before submitting your PR.

---

## Commit Message Guidelines

Use clear, descriptive commit messages.

Recommended format:

Examples:
- `feat: add support for user-defined species`
- `fix: resolve convergence issue in solver`
- `docs: update README installation section`
- `refactor: simplify stream validation logic`

Common types:
- `feat`
- `fix`
- `docs`
- `refactor`
- `test`
- `chore`

---

## Documentation

Good documentation is as valuable as good code.

If your change:
- Adds a feature → update the README or relevant docs
- Changes behaviour → document the change
- Introduces new configuration → explain how to use it

---

## Testing

If the project includes tests:
- Add tests for new features
- Update tests if behaviour changes
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting

---

## Questions

If you’re unsure about anything:
- Open a discussion
- Open a draft pull request
- Ask in an issue before starting large changes

We appreciate your time and effort in contributing.

Thank you for helping improve this project.
